(1) Apache Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform.
(3) It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform, is dynamically compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates with other Java code and libraries.
(5) Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy, although semantics may be different.
(7) Since version 2, Groovy can also be compiled statically, offering type inference, and performance near that of Java.
(9) Groovy has since changed its governance structure to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation.
